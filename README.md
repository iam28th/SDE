# Numerical Monte-Carlo solution to the system of stochastic differential equations of population dynamics

## Goals and objectives
The final aim of this project was to apply It̂o's stochastic differential equations (SDEs) approach to the field of population dynamics and to compare a stochastic population dynamics model with a deterministic one. In order to use this approach, several tasks should be covered:
1. Stochastic process modelling
2. It̂o's stochastic integral modelling and approximate calculation of its expectations
3. Obtaining numerical solutions to stochastic differential equation (SDE) using Monte-Carlo simulation
Author also have set a personal goal to make as much HoMM3 references as possible.
