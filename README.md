# Numerical Monte-Carlo solution to system of stochastic differential equations of population dynamics

## Goals and objectives
The final goal was to provide a 

1. Stochastic process modelling
2. ItÌ‚o's stochastic integral modelling and approximate calculation of its expectations
3. Obtaining numerical solutions to stochastic differential equation (SDE) using Monte-Carlo simulation
4. Making as much HoMM3 references as possible
